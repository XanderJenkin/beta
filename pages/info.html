			<p> I really love and enjoy coding, and I would like to do it professionally and for the rest of my life. 
			It’s incredibly difficult and frustrating; after all, humans are generally best at thinking like humans, not robots. 
			But when you realize and get how to do it and the pieces link, it’s something like no other, and it’s truly magical. 
			Whether it’s Python, HTML, or even (in the case above) Java, I absolutely love it, and as a career goes, 
			I don’t think I could ever do anything else. </p>

		<div class = "plx_academy"></div>
		<div class = "txt_box_white">
			<p>I really love and enjoy the academy, and it has given me the tools to do things I never would have thought possible. 
			I owe so much of what I know to my 2 favorite teachers, Google and Mr. Swiatek, 
			and my webpage wouldn’t look nearly this nie without them, 
			so I thank them and the program for all the hard work on teaching me how to code!</p>

		<div class = "txt_box_gray">
			<p>I really love and enjoy tinkering and messing around with electronics, 
			and when I first got into the world of PC Building, it was something that has kept me even now. 
			I got a used desktop from one of my Mom’s friends and threw some parts from Amazon in it, and the rest is history. 
			I enjoy building PC’s almost as much as I enjoy using them, and I’m glad I saved up the money to build my own, 
			even if my cable management needs a little work…</p>

		<div class = "txt_box_white" style = "min-height: 300px;">
			<p>As far as what my future holds, I plan to <span class = "bold">learn HTML</span>, create my 
			own <span class = "bold">website</span> and <span class = "bold">manage</span> it. 
			I would also like to become an <span class = "bold">expert</span> in <span class = "bold">Python</span> and
			<span class = "bold">write</span> my own <span class = "bold">programs,</span> learn <span class = "bold">C++</span>
			and eventually <span class = "bold">make programs</span> in that. Eventually, I’d be nice to work at a major tech company like 
			<span class = "bold">Google, Microsoft, Amazon,</span> etc., and I want to be <span class = "bold">fluent</span> in
			as many programming languages as possible. And as far as career choice goes, I’ve honestly grown quite fond of 
			everything that’s been thrown at me in the realm of <span class = "bold">Computer Science,</span> so 
			I don’t know exactly what I’ll want to do in that field. 
			But as I explore more aspects of Computer Science through my years to come in the <span class = "bold">Academy,</span> 
			I suspect I will find something that really strikes my interest, and that’ll likely be 
			what I nail down as my future career, but I <span class = "bold">know</span> I’ll be coding, 
			that’s for <span class = "bold">sure.</span></p>
